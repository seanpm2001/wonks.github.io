## Abstract

Racket is an ecosystem for developing and deploying new languages, but
for most of the languages developed in Racket the final destination is
Racket VM. In this talk, we will talk about how we can write DSL's
in Racket with a different compilation path, along with the ability to
use all of the cool stuff Racket already provides.
