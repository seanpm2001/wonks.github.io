## Abstract

This year, at the Dyalog â€™17 user meeting, Roger Hui presented a neat and tidy exposition of a performance optimization for index selfies. I would like to demo this little programming pearl for your enjoyment. Unlike some APL, this is an example of APL in use as a tool of thought for performance and algorithmic exploration/exposition instead of solving non-computer science problem domains.
