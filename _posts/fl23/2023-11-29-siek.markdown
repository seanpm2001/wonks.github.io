## Abstract

The logical relations technique is widely used to prove properties of programming languages,
from simple applications such as termination of the simply-typed lambda calculus, to more
advanced ones such as proving noninterference for languages with information-flow security.
For languages that are not strongly normalizing, one usually adapts the logical relations
proof technique by using step-indexing. Doing so by hand is tedious, so Dreyer, Ahmed, and Birkedal
created a temporal logic named LSLR that hides some of the work.

In this talk I give an introduction to using a step-indexed logic to define logical relations and to
prove type safety of the simply-typed lambda calculus with fix (general recursion).
